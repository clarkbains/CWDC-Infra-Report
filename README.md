# CWDC Infrastructure Report
The Carleton Web Development Club, CWDC, is a small club at Carleton University. These documents outline a project proposal and report on the Infrastructure. This repository has been prepared for evaluation in the COMP 4000 course at Carleton University, as a implementation experience.

## Hooks
I am experimenting with a pre commit hook to compile the LaTeX sources into both a PDF and txt document. You may run into issues committing if you do not have `pdflatex` and `pdftotext` installed on your system.
